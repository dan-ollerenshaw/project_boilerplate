# Example project
 This is a dummy project for housing all the useful development boilerplate that often ends up in projects.

Goal: cloning the repo and running everything on a different machine should work just fine,
with no tricky setup steps required.

TODO:
- use pyinstaller for building an exe
- setup.py (?)
- finish writing up README


### Misc setup steps:
- needed to add tox dir to system path to run it from the command line
- pylintrc file generated using the `--generate-rcfile` option
- made some manual adjustments to the autogenerated pylintrc file to suit my preferences
- to run tox, you either need a pyproject.toml or a (non-empty) setup.py, or you
  need to specify `skipsdist=True` in tox.ini
  
### Docs:
 sphinx setup: sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html.
Run `sphinx-quickstart` within the docs dir.

We made a few customisations to the autogenerated sphinx files:
- conf.py: add extensions, add napoleon settings, add src to sys.path
- index.rst: add refs to custom .rst files
- reference/index.rst: for autodocs (I think)
- I added a my_documentation.rst file, as an example.
- Not using make.bat or Makefile, so removed them.

Obviously the docs are pretty bare bones from this, but it's a starting point.
